# Python Exercises for Royce

## Q1
Write a program to print this:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

## Q2
Write a program to print this:
```
1
12
123
1234
12345
```

## Q3
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their year of birth. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.


## Q4
### Odd Or Even
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
print out an appropriate message to the user. 

Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.


## Q5

Take a list, say for example this one:
```
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
```
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than N, where N is a number you must take an input from the user. 
Required: Make a new list that contains all the numbers.


## Q6
Take two lists, say for example these two:
```
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
```
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements
that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your
program works on two lists of different sizes.


## Q7
Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.
(For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no
divisors.)
Take this opportunity to practice using functions, described below.


## Q8
Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers
to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to
think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the
user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to
generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers
where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous
two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

So if the user enters 5, your program should print: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5

## Q9 
Take a number N from the user and print the Nth term in fibonacci series using RECURSION


## Q10
Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for
a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the
user the same string, except with the words in backwards
order. For example, say I type the string:
```
  My name is Michele
```
Then I would see the string:
```
  Michele is name My
```
shown back to me.


## Q11
Implement the following functions:

```python
def contains(alist, x):
	pass

def create_new_list(size):
	pass

def filter(x):
	pass

def find_index(x):
	pass

def double(alist):
	pass

def multiply(alist, x):
	pass

def double_and_multiply(alist, x):
	pass

```
