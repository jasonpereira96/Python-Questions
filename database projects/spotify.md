![Spotify](spot.jpg)


Congratulations! 

You have been hired as the lead data engineer at Spotify. The CEO wants you to redesign the entire data model of Spotify from ground up 
using MySQL. Your data model must support all the current features of Spotify. Open the app, have a look at all the screens of the UI and come up with a design. You will go through multiple iterations of refinement of the data model with CEO, where you'll discuss missing features, design descions and
best practices.

This is an open-ended question. There is no single right answer.

Here's a list of a few requirements to get you started:

- Spotfiy has a huge database of songs
- Each song has an artist
- A song can have multiple artists (eg: Run this Town - Kanye and Rihanna)
- Users can make playlists
- Users can favourite songs
- Users has 3 subscription plans - free, premium and premium+
- Songs are part of albums are also part of multiple genres
- It would be nice to have an analytics dashboard that gives an admin a birds eye view of important statistics
- Users can make playlists, but spotify has its own featured playlists which are curated by the admin
- Users subscribe to Spotify by adding their credit card details so that the subscription amount is auto-deducted every month. You will
have to store all the users' personal details like name, phone number, address, etc for tax purposes. 
- Users can add multiple credit cards

This is not a full list of requirements. Check the app to figure out what else needs to be covered.


Prepare an ER diagram and a database diagram and upload it here for approval by the CEO.


All the best!
